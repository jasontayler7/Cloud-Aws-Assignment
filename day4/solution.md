   ![startinstance2](https://github.com/kamal24111991/Cloud-Aws-Assignment/blob/master/day4/media/startinstance2.png)


Stopping 3 instance on tag basis:

   ![stopinstance](https://github.com/kamal24111991/Cloud-Aws-Assignment/blob/master/day4/media/stopinstance.png)
   ![stopinstance2](https://github.com/kamal24111991/Cloud-Aws-Assignment/blob/master/day4/media/stopinstance2.png)
